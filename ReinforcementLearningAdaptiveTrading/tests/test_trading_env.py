import pytest
# import numpy as np
# import pandas as pd
# from src.environment.trading_env import TradingEnv
# from src.config import DEFAULT_CONFIG # For using a consistent config structure in tests

# This file will contain unit tests for the TradingEnv class.
# Tests should cover:
# - Environment initialization with various configurations.
# - Reset functionality: correct initial observation, portfolio reset.
# - Step functionality:
#   - Correct P&L calculation for long, short, flat positions.
#   - Correct transaction cost application.
#   - Correct reward calculation (including P&L, volatility penalty, drawdown penalty).
#   - Correct 'done' signal (end of data, stop-loss, max episode steps).
#   - Correct observation updates.
# - Action space and observation space conformity.
# - Stop-loss triggering.
# - Behavior with empty or minimal data.

# Example structure for a test:
# def test_env_initialization():
#     dummy_config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy() # Or a minimal config for this test
#     # Create minimal dummy_df for initialization
#     # dummy_df = pd.DataFrame(...) 
#     # env = TradingEnv(data_df=dummy_df, config=dummy_config)
#     # assert env is not None
#     # assert env.action_space.n == 3
#     # obs = env.reset()
#     # assert obs.shape == env.observation_space.shape
#     pass

# def test_step_long_profit():
#     # Setup env with specific data where a long position should profit
#     # Take a 'long' action
#     # Check reward and portfolio value
#     pass

# def test_transaction_costs():
#     # Setup env
#     # Take actions that change position (e.g., flat to long, long to short)
#     # Check that transaction costs are subtracted from reward/portfolio
#     pass

# def test_stop_loss():
#     # Setup env with data that will cause a large drawdown
#     # Take actions leading to the drawdown
#     # Check that 'done' becomes True and a penalty might be applied
#     pass
