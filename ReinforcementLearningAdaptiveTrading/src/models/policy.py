# ReinforcementLearningAdaptiveTrading/src/models/policy.py

# This file is intended for defining custom neural network policies if the default
# policies provided by Stable Baselines3 (e.g., MlpPolicy, CnnPolicy) are not sufficient.

# For this project, we primarily rely on Stable Baselines3's default 'MlpPolicy'
# for the PPO agent, which constructs a Multi-Layer Perceptron for both the actor (policy)
# and the critic (value function).

# If customization of the network architecture is needed (e.g., different number of layers,
# different activation functions, custom feature extractors, or recurrent layers like LSTMs),
# this is where those custom policy classes would be defined.

# Example of how a custom policy might be structured (for illustration):
# from stable_baselines3.common.policies import ActorCriticPolicy
# import torch.nn as nn
# from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Type, Union
# from gymnasium import spaces # Changed from gym to gymnasium
# import torch as th


# class CustomMlpPolicy(ActorCriticPolicy):

# To use a custom policy like the one above, you would pass it to the PPO constructor:
# from .policy import CustomMlpPolicy # Assuming this file is policy.py inside a 'models' module
# model = PPO(CustomMlpPolicy, env, ...)

# Additionally, this file could contain utility functions for:
# - Saving/loading custom model parameters if not fully handled by SB3's model.save/load.
# - Defining custom feature extractors if the observation space is complex (e.g., dictionaries).
