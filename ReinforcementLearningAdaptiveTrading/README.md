# Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Trading (PPO Agent)

## Project Overview

**Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Trading (PPO Agent)** is a solo project that trains a reinforcement learning agent to trade a 10-year Treasury futures contract by going **long**, **short**, or **flat** (no position) at each time step. The objective is to maximize **risk-adjusted returns** (e.g. high Sharpe ratio) rather than just raw profit. The agent is trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (**PPO**) algorithm, a stable actor-critic RL method known for clipping policy updates to ensure training stability. The project demonstrates deep reinforcement learning expertise (custom gym environment, policy/value networks, vectorized training), financial domain knowledge (using features like yield curve slope, volatility, trend indicators), and strong coding practices (modular design, reusability, testability, and comprehensive documentation). Importantly, it also emphasizes **explainability** – for example, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the trained policy’s decisions – which is valuable for interviews and building trust in the model.

In summary, this project trains a PPO agent on historical treasury market data (training period 2000–2015) and evaluates it on out-of-sample data (2016–2023) to see if the agent can outperform basic strategies. The repository is structured in a clear, modular way with separate components for data processing, environment definition, model training, evaluation, and testing. Each module and function is well-documented with docstrings and the **README** provides guidance and prompts that make it easy to discuss the design decisions during interviews.

## Repository Structure

The project follows a professional repository structure typical for machine learning projects. Below is an overview of the folder and file layout, along with brief descriptions of each component:

To train the PPO agent, run:
```bash
python src/train.py --config_path src/config.py
```
(Further arguments and options can be detailed here)

### Evaluating a Trained Agent

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.zip --data_split test
```

## Key Design Choices & Discussion Points (Q&A Style)

*   **Q: Why use PPO for this trading problem?**
    *   A: PPO is known for its stability and good sample efficiency in various environments. It balances exploration and exploitation well, and its clipped objective function helps prevent overly large policy updates, which is beneficial in noisy environments like financial markets. Stable Baselines3 provides a reliable implementation.

*   **Q: How is the reward function designed for risk-adjusted returns?**
    *   A: The reward function isn't just raw profit/loss. It incorporates penalties for volatility and drawdowns. For example: `reward = P&L – λ_vol * (volatility_penalty) – λ_dd * (drawdown_penalty)`. This encourages the agent to generate smoother equity curves and maximize metrics like the Sharpe ratio.

*   **Q: Why a custom Gym environment?**
    *   A: A custom environment (`TradingEnv`) allows us to precisely model the specifics of the 10Y Treasury futures market, including transaction costs, the impact of actions (long/short/flat), and the custom reward shaping. This gives full control over the simulation.

*   **Q: What features are used and why?**
    *   A: The agent uses features like yield curve slope (macro indicator), market volatility (risk measure), and trend/momentum indicators (price direction). These are common financial indicators that provide context about market conditions. See the "Data and Feature Engineering" section for more details.

*   **Q: How do you handle data splitting and avoid lookahead bias?**
    *   A: Data is strictly split into training (2000-2015) and testing (2016-2023) periods. All feature calculations use only past data (lagged information) to prevent any lookahead bias.

*   **Q: How is model interpretability addressed?**
    *   A: We use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze feature importance for the trained policy. We also examine agent behavior in specific scenarios and analyze trade statistics. This helps in understanding *why* the agent makes certain decisions.

## Next Steps / Future Work
*   Incorporate more sophisticated features or alternative data sources.
*   Experiment with different RL algorithms or policy architectures (e.g., LSTMs for memory).
*   Develop a more granular validation strategy (e.g., walk-forward validation).
*   Integrate live data for paper trading or real-time decision support.
