    "This notebook is for evaluating the fully trained agent and interpreting its behavior. Key tasks:\n",
    "- Load the best trained model from `models/best_model.zip`.\n",
    "- Evaluate the agent on the out-of-sample test set.\n",
    "- Plot equity curves of the agent vs. baseline strategies (e.g., Buy & Hold, MA Crossover).\n",
    "- Display performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, annualized return, etc.).\n",
    "- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze feature importance for the agent's decisions.\n",
    "- Visualize SHAP force plots or summary plots.\n",
    "- Analyze specific trades or agent behavior during significant market events."
